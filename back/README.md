First, set your app's secret key as an environment variable. For example,
add the following to ``.bashrc`` or ``.bash_profile``.

    export CONDUIT_SECRET='something-really-secret'

Before running shell commands, set the ``FLASK_APP`` and ``FLASK_DEBUG``
environment variables ::

    export FLASK_APP=/path/to/autoapp.py
    export FLASK_DEBUG=1
    
Then run the following commands to bootstrap your environment ::

    git clone https://github.com/gothinkster/flask-realworld-example-app.git
    cd flask-realworld-example-app
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt


Run the following commands to create your app's
database tables and perform the initial migration ::

    flask db init
    flask db migrate
    flask db upgrade

To run the web application use::

    flask run --with-threads
